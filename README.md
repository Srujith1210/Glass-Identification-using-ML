Built a multiclass machine learning model to identify glass types using chemical composition data from the UCI repository. Implemented Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and SVM with hyperparameter tuning and evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
